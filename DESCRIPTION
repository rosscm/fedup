Description:
    An R package that tests for enrichment and depletion of user-defined
    pathways using a Fisher's exact test. The method is designed for versatile
    pathway annotation formats (eg. gmt, txt, xlsx) to allow the user to run
    pathway analysis on custom annotations. This package is also
    integrated with Cytoscape to provide network-based pathway visualization
    that enhances the interpretability of the results.
